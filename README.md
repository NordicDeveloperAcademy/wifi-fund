# Wi-Fi Fundamentals Course Exercises
This repository is part of the [Wi-Fi Fundamentals](https://academy.nordicsemi.com/courses/wi-fi-fundamentals/) course by [Nordic Developer Academy](https://academy.nordicsemi.com).

The Wi-Fi Fundamentals course is an online, self-paced course that focuses on teaching the basics of Wi-Fi using Nordic Semiconductor’s nRF7002 companion IC. Through hands-on learning, participants will learn how to create a Wi-Fi prototype using the highly extensible and feature-right nRF Connect SDK.

Upon completion of the course, participants will have a thorough understanding of the Wi-Fi protocol and its layers, as well as knowledge of available APIs in the nRF Connect SDK, which is based on the Zephyr RTOS. Additionally, participants will have gained practical experience in configuring Wi-Fi connections and developing Wi-Fi applications.

This repository contains the exercise code base and solutions. Make sure to select the directory that corresponds with the nRF Connect SDK version of your choosing:

v2.9.0-v2.8.0: For nRF Connect SDK versions v2.8.0 to v2.9.0
v2.7.0-v2.5.0: For nRF Connect SDK versions v2.5.0 to v2.7.0

The course supports the following hardware:
 - [nRF7002 DK](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-hardware/nRF7002-DK) (stand-alone)
 - [nRF7002 EK](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-hardware/nRF7002-EK) with the [nRF5340 DK](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Software-and-tools/Development-Kits/nRF5340-DK)
